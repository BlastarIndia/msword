In order to use the $DEBUG.INI and $FAST.INI files, you should:

1) Rename the files to get rid of the dollar sign
2) Add x:\OPUS\TOOLS to your path in AUTOEXEC.BAT
3) In the .INI files, change BUILD= to point to your debug objects directory
   (such as C:\OPUS\DEBUGOBJ, for example...you will have to MKDIR the
   DEBUGOBJ directory yourself)
4) Type MAKEOPUS -? after the above is completed and read the directions
   about using MAKEOPUS.
